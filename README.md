# Roadmap
I've been unhappy with the quality and lack of standards in my code for some time. This is my push to change that.

The entire site will be recoded from the ground up. During this process I also plan to implement many of the new features I've never gotten around to adding before.

New Features / Things to Change:

1. Wallet password reset
2. Wallet address labeling
3. Wallet address deleting
4. Wallet cold storage option
5. Better OMC sending control (multiple recipients, custom fees)
6. Add loading bars to actions like sending OMC and importing private keys
7. Setup proper private key importing
8. Show balances next to addresses
9. Wallet address book
10. Move entire site to API calls via AJAX
11. Pagination / Sorting
12. Proper RESTful API with rate limiting
13. Proper mobile sizing of long strings
14. Ability to lookup unconfirmed transactions
15. Ability to (possibly) explore alternate blockchains
